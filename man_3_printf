.SH NAME " Manpage for _printf. "

.TH man 3 "30 Mar 2023" "1.0" "_printf man page"

.SH SYNOPSIS
#include "main.h"
int _printf(const char *format, ...);

.SH DESCRIPTION
The _printf() function produces output according to a format specified by a string format.

The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the % character. The arguments must correspond properly (after type promotion) with the conversion specifier. By default, _printf() is implemented in a simple way. It prints each character of the format string, except for format specifiers, as it is read from left to right.

Supported format specifiers:
%c - prints a single character
%s - prints a string of characters
%d - prints an integer in base 10
%i - prints an integer in base 10
%% - prints a percent sign

.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings). If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

.SH COMPILED

Your code will be compiled this way:
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 -Wno-format *.c
